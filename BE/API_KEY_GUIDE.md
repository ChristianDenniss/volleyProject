2. Go to the admin dashboard (`/portal/dashboard`)
3. Look for the "Generate API Key" button in the Quick Actions section

2. Add it to your `.env` file: `API_SECRET_KEY=your-generated-key-here`
3. Restart your backend server
4. Use it in Postman or other tools

## **Using the API Key**

### **In Postman:**
Add this header to your requests:

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/players \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-generated-key-here" \
